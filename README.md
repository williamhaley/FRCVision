# FRC Vision Application

A very simple vision application program for the First Robotics Competition.

This program adds a couple files, but otherwise tries to keep the sample Java application from FRC intact.

See [FRC Vision Processing with a Raspberry Pi Coprocessor](https://willhaley.com/blog/frc-vision-coprocessor/) and the official WPILib docs for more information.
